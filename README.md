## Deliverables

 - All the code you used to create the prototype as a public git repo or a `.zip` file

      https://github.com/Ronald-Crosby/olly-robinson-catch-test

 - Instructions on how to run the protoype page in a README.md file along with:

  # Instructions
    - Clone repo to local folder
    - navigate to local folder in command line
    - run npm install
    - open index.html file in your browser
    - Gulp 3 has issues running on Node V12 so try changing to Node V10 if you run into trouble running Gulp in the command line.

- A quick summary of your approach

    - I have kept the project as simple as possible and used a basic setup for compiling and minifying the SCSS and JS files.
    - The document is structured with a header containing the logo and the nav link and a single section containing the page's content.
    - I used CSS grid to achieve a responsive image card structure.
    - I used vanilla JS for the two functions: opening and closing the filter list and adding an active state to the selected button

- A quick summary of any problems you ran into

    - I ran into some problems getting the project transfered into a new git repo and pushed to my github. I have been using the command line for Git which definitley makes life harder than it needs to be. I am going to start using GitHub desktop or SourceTree which are definitely more user-friendly.

- A quick summary of what you might have done differently with more time

    - If I had more time I would look at the site's scalability by creating variables within scss for things like colors, commonly used spacings and position values. I would also build the image card are a reusable component in php and pass in the text and image path.
